# 2K25: Object Oriented typescript

This guide provides an overview of the key concepts in TypeScript, along with practical examples and detailed explanations. Whether you are a beginner or someone looking to refresh your knowledge, this guide covers the essentials of TypeScript, including data types, functions, destructuring, operators, and advanced types.

## ðŸ›  TypeScript Project Setup

### 1. Initialize TypeScript

```bash
tsc --init
```

### 2. Update `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./src/",
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Install ts-node-dev

```bash
npm install -g ts-node-dev
```

### 4. Run the project

```bash
ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/index.ts
```

# Welcome to Object-Oriented TypeScript

Welcome back to the next step in your TypeScript journey!

In this module, you'll dive into the heart of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Here's what you'll explore:

### Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

We will introduce you to object-oriented programming. You'll learn what OOP is and how OOP principles help structure and maintain complex codebases.

### Class and Object

Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances that encapsulate both state and behavior. You'll learn how to define classes with properties and methods, create objects from them, and understand why this pattern is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications.

### Inheritance in OOP

Continuing our exploration of OOP, weâ€™ll talk about inheritance, one of the most powerful tools for code reuse. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, creating a parent-child relationship.

### Type Guard using `typeof` & `in`

When working with dynamic types, it's crucial to ensure you're dealing with the expected type. TypeScript offers type guards to help with this. You'll explore how to use the `typeof` operator and the `in` keyword to safely implement conditional logic based on variable types.

### Type Guard using `instanceof`

Building on your knowledge of type guards, you'll explore the `instanceof` operator â€” a powerful tool for checking whether an object is an instance of a specific class, especially useful in class hierarchies.

### Access Modifiers

Access modifiers are key to controlling the visibility of class members. Youâ€™ll learn about `public`, `private`, and `protected` in TypeScript, and how they help enforce encapsulation.

### Getter and Setter

Take control of how your class properties are accessed and modified! You'll learn how to define getters and setters in TypeScript and explore their practical benefits.

### Static Members in OOP

Static properties and methods belong to the class itself, not to instances. We'll show you how to declare and use `static` members in TypeScript effectively.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as if they are the same through a shared interface or base class. Youâ€™ll implement polymorphism and understand its importance in flexible application design.

### Abstraction in OOP

Abstraction hides implementation details and exposes only essential features. You'll learn to create abstract classes and interfaces to define clear and robust contracts in your code.

### Encapsulation in OOP

Encapsulation ensures that internal class details are hidden and protected. Weâ€™ll demonstrate how to implement encapsulation using private properties and access modifiers.

With this knowledge, you can confidently build complex applications that are both maintainable and resilient. Keep practicing and experimenting with these concepts. The more you apply them, the more intuitive they will become!
